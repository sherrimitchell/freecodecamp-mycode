# freecodecamp-mycode
This repository contains my coding exercises from the FreeCodeCamp bootcamp. It is my record of all of my completed exercises and any work in progress. As I complete challenges, I will save it here as a record of my progress.

I am posting solutions as I work through and complete them. I have not updated any of the solutions as I've progressed so far. This is more or less a way for me to keep track of what I am learning.

Although this is more or less a journal of sorts for me, this repository is public and if you are a part of FCC feel free to take a look at my solutions. I hope that it can be of help.

## My Goal:
I am working toward the full-stack certification. I am also a Ruby on Rail developer, and I felt that this was a good way to get even more comfortable with front-end development.
