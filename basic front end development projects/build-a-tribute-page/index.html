        <blockquote><p style="font-size:14px">"I got everything from Johnny ... He was my main model ... My whole ballad style comes from my imitating Johnny's style ... He was the baddest and the best ... Johnny Guitar Watson was not just a guitarist: the man was a master musician. He could call out charts; he could write a beautiful melody or a nasty groove at the drop of a hat; he could lay on the harmonies and he could come up with a whole sound. They call Elvis, the King; but the sure-enough king was Johnny 'Guitar' Watson." <footer>Etta James</footer></p></blockquote></div>

    <p style="font-size:14px">Watson toured with such luminaries as Little Richard and acquired a reputation for exciting stage theatrics. "I used to play the guitar standing on my hands," he recalled in an interview quoted by the Guinness volume. "I had a 1 50-foot cord and I could get on top of the auditorium--those things Jimi Hendrix was doing, I started that s--t." It is entirely possible that Hendrix followed Watson's example, for the two musicians shared similar backgrounds and aims.</p>
